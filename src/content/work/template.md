I am currently a web development student with a focus on **front-end**, continuously learning new programming concepts and applying them to personal projects and exercises. While my formal experience in companies is limited, I am dedicated to my professional growth, working on independent projects to improve my skills.

- **Web interface development**: Creating web pages and applications using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Git, and GitHub.
- **Continuous learning**: Always seeking new challenges and opportunities to deepen my knowledge of front-end technologies.
- **Personal projects**: Worked on open-source projects and web applications to enhance my technical skills.
