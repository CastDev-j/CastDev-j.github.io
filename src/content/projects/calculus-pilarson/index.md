### About the Project  
This project approximates π using the Leibniz series and Larson's formula. The user can adjust the number of iterations to observe how the approximation improves with more iterations.

### Key Features  
1. **Leibniz Series**: The core of this project is the approximation of π using the Leibniz series.
2. **Adjustable Iterations**: You can adjust the number of iterations using a slider to see how the precision of the approximation improves.
3. **Larson's Formula**: An additional formula is included for comparison, illustrating different methods of approximation.

### How to Use  
1. **Adjust the Iterations**: Use the slider to change the number of iterations.
2. **Observe the Approximation**: Watch as the approximation of π becomes more accurate with higher iterations.

### Example of Approximation  
Given the number of iterations set to 1000, the π approximation may look something like this:

```
π ≈ 3.14159
```

### Conclusion  
This tool allows you to explore how the Leibniz series and Larson's formula can be used to approximate π, demonstrating the effect of iteration count on precision.
