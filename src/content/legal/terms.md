Welcome to my portfolio! 🎨✨ Please read these fun Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the [https://castdev-j.pages.dev/] website (the "Service") operated by Andrés Castillo ("us", "we", or "our"). 🖥️💻

Everything on this site (yes, even the long nights of debugging 😅) belongs to me unless stated otherwise. If you'd like to use something, just ask nicely! 💌

#### User Representations 🎯👩‍💻
Feel free to click around, learn, and get inspired 🌟. Just don’t break the site, okay? 🛠️ I’ve spent countless hours building it, and I’d rather keep it drama-free. 🕊️

#### Links to Other Websites 🌐🔗
If I’ve included any links, it’s because they’re cool 😎 or useful 💡. I’m not responsible for what happens if you click them, though – proceed with curiosity! 🧭✨
